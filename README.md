9. Liability.

9.1 Infringement. If any portion of, or functionality implemented by, 	the Original Code becomes the subject of a claim of infringement, ViraTrace must, at its option: (a) attempt to procure the rights necessary for ViraTrace and You to continue using the Affected 	Original Code, and in the interim modify the Affected Original Code 	so that it is no longer infringing; or (b) suspend Your rights to use, reproduce, modify, sublicense and distribute the Affected 	Original Code until a final determination of the claim is made by a court or governmental agency of competent jurisdiction and ViraTrace lifts the suspension as set forth below. Such suspension of rights will be effective immediately upon ViraTrace’s posting of a notice to such effect on the Git repository that is used for implementation of this License. Upon such final determination being made, if ViraTrace is legally able, without the payment of a fee or royalty, to resume use, reproduction, modification, sublicensing and distribution of the Affected Original Code, ViraTrace shall lift the suspension of rights to the Affected Original code by 	posting a notice to such effect on the Git repository that is used for implementation of this License. If ViraTrace suspends your rights to Affected Original Code, nothing in this License shall be construed to restrict You, at Your option and subject to applicable law, from replacing the Affected Original code with non-infringing code or independently negotiating for necessary rights from such third party.

9.2 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL VIRATRACE BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS LICENSE OR YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE ORIGINAL CODE, OR ANY PORTION THEREOF, WHETHER UNDER A THEORY OF CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCTS LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF VIRATRACE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY REMEDY.
